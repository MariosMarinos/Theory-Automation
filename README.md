# Theory Automation 
It was built due to the course Automata Theory on the 7th semester.
Program takes as input a .txt file that contains a description of an Automation DFA,NFA or NFA with e-transitions as on the example NFA-with-e-transitions1.txt. 
You can run it by python DFA.py <filename.txt>, and then it waits for words to be checked if they are acceptable by the automato and prints True if they are, oterwhise prints False.
